/*
Errors Meanings
	WRONG_SENSOR_PLACEMENT: When Valve is open for longer then 2 hours, it is assumed that either the sensor is placed wrong or there is something wrong with the water source or pipes/hoses - this is the only error that can be resolves by just pressing the button
	VOLTAGELOW:		When Voltage got too low (<4V when driving, <7V before driving). Usually Valve ends up in a safe closed position
	HIGH_CURRENT:	When Current got too high when closing (the motor could potentially damage itself without this). Causes: End Stop Button is damaged or out of physical Range (Housing Deformation) OR motor gears are broken OR problems with motor brushes or coils. Valve might end up in an open or partly open position.
	VALVE_TIMEOUT:	When the Motor was driving a certain time and the valve is still not closed. Causes: Damaged Motor Gears, solder error on PCB, disconnected cables to the motor, malfunctioning motor driver IC, motor driver IC in sleep mode. Also occurs while assembling when motor shaft must be turned in a suitable position to attach the valve parts. Valve is probably in an open or partly open position.
